My first inclination was to just slap some text into this that fit the most basic criteria and focus solely on the lessons, the coding.  Not that it would have been “bad” or “subpar”, it just would have been surface deep.  After a period of consideration I decided that I was going to resist that urge, resist the idea of “just the surface”.  If I was to really understand this journey, really throw myself on this path of self improvement despite all obstacles, I needed to know why I did things as well as how.  And besides that, for all my big talk of wanting to help people become more, make the world better by example, it’s important to explain why to them, to help them adjust to their circumstances, otherwise, without that deeper understanding, it’s just bs, mystical advice from some silly self proclaimed guru of dubious origin.
		
The reasons why I decided to study Software Engineering can actually be simply explained as 2 things, money and time.  I’ve worked at more jobs than I can count without pause.  I crossed off an entire bucket list by the time I was 20 and rewrote it and checked off more.  It wasn't a conscious decision to do these things, it was something deeper.

I was born into poverty and privilege. By this I mean my mom was 1 of 12 children from a connected family of means. Then, when she ended up as a single mom of a 1 yr old after leaving an abusive drug addict, she was determined to raise me on her own, rejecting any monetary help from her parents. He would be out of the picture entirely until I met him for the 1st time when I was 26.

All of this resulted in my attending one of the worst schools in the area until I went to high school. Gangs, drugs, a sadly high percentage of 6th 7th, and 8th grade pregnancies.  We ate the same things every day because they were affordable. The heater never went past 63 in the winter unless it was a special treat. Holes in my clothes.  Hearing my mom cry over the struggle of raising a boy with no father, struggling to make ends meet.  Eventually she accepted Gramma's offer of babysitting. That's when I became the '13th child', spending half my time in world of the poor and the violent, and the other half in a world of privilege.  

Growing up like that gave me a unique perspective. "If only I had money" my schoolmates would say, but I saw the lives of the people living the Dream, and they weren't very happy either. I heard the old and infirm every week in the nursing homes, as I went with Gramma to care for her family, hours listening to people on the verge of death tell me "if only I did this, if only I did that".  Coming the next week to find them gone, but there was always someone else to share wisdom. So money wasn't the key. It was nice to have, but not the key.

So I lived like that, setting goals and trying to achieve them. Some were a success, some not so much, but I LIVED with all my might. I had no kids, nothing to really force me into stability.  I did ok on money sometimes and the times I didn't I landed ok. When I was 20 I didn't mind sleeping on my motorcycle so much. By the time I met my wife I had worked  in over 50 types of work. I chased the stars in my eyes. Or the higher pay. Whatever was interesting. 

But then I started having kids but I got hurt, badly, at a steel mill, and walking unaided was no longer possible. I tried to work for years, but eventually reality forced my hand and I was awarded a full disability.  Suddenly, there was no money or overtime, and my wife had kids to care for and a husband that some days could not care for his own most basic need. 

It took me 6 years to get myself back into shape despite the doctor's prognosis. So I went to work as a Deputy because I felt like all the other things had no meaning, left behind nothing of worth. The problem was I worked for a very low paying county, so I didn't make much more than before. The few years of regularly fighting combative drugged up users did irreparable damage, and eventually my spine fell apart just getting up from the couch, and I ended up on the floor and eventually back on disability. This time the damage was far worse. 

But I don't quit. That was 2 years ago. I spent the last year studying, from server management to web development and data science, looking for the best fit. I designed my setup so that I can work in any physical condition, any position.  Since boot camp started I’ve had multiple days with the “chatters”, where just rolling over causes tears, but I am STILL on track, right on schedule. I WILL NOT QUIT!


I know money doesn't solve every problem, but it allows me to hire the professionals who can. It allows me to make sure my kids have everything they need, without struggle, stress, and strife. By completing the bootcamp, proving my skills, I can get a remote job that does these things without the 90 hour work weeks and being a stranger to my family.
